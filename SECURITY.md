# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

This document outlines Crystal's vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to our [GitHub Security page](https://github.com/stravu/crystal/security). If you prefer to submit one without using GitHub, you can also email us at [security@stravu.com](mailto:security@stravu.com).

We commit to acknowledging vulnerability reports immediately, and will work to fix active vulnerabilities as soon as we can. We will publish resolved vulnerabilities in the form of security advisories on our GitHub security page.

We appreciate your help making this project secure for everyone. Thank you for your support and responsible disclosure.
